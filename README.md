# ruby-brainfuck

A Ruby program to interpret Brainfuck.

Written for the [Reddit daily programmer][rdp] challenge

[rdp]: http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/210j6i/21314_challenge_153_hard_interpreting_interpreters/#

## Usage

```
ruby brainfuck.rb
```

This will automatically run the program titled `program.bf`. There are
3 example files included with this repo. To use them, simply copy one
to the appropriate name.

This is deliberately simple Ruby in order to make writing the
[Ruby interpreter][cljrb] that can run this code easier!
